                <p class="mb-4 jus">Ultrasound-guided biopsies are a type of minimally invasive procedure used to obtain tissue samples from various parts of the body. The use of ultrasound allows for real-time visualization, increasing the accuracy and safety of the biopsy. Ultrasound provides real-time imaging, helping the physician to precisely locate the area of interest.The patient is positioned to allow optimal access to the biopsy site. The area is cleaned and prepped, and local anesthesia is administered to minimize discomfort. A thin, hollow needle is guided to the target area using the ultrasound images. The physician can see the needle in real-time, ensuring accurate placement. The needle is used to extract small samples of tissue from the target area. Depending on the type of biopsy, this might involve a single insertion or multiple passes to obtain sufficient tissue.</p>
