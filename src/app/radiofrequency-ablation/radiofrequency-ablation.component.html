                <p class="mb-4 jus">Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive procedure used to destroy abnormal tissues using heat generated by radiofrequency energy. It is commonly used in the treatment of various conditions, particularly in oncology, cardiology, and pain management.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 jus">RFA involves inserting a thin, needle-like probe into the target tissue. Radiofrequency energy is then delivered through the probe, generating heat that destroys the targeted cells. The procedure is typically performed under imaging guidance to ensure precise targeting. The patient is positioned based on the target site. Local anesthesia or sedation is administered to ensure comfort. Ultrasound, CT, or MRI is used to visualize the target area. The ablation probe is inserted through the skin and advanced to the target tissue. Radiofrequency energy is delivered through the probe, heating and destroying the abnormal tissue. The temperature and duration of ablation are carefully controlled. The probe is removed. A small bandage is applied to the insertion site. The patient is monitored for a short period before being discharged.</p>
