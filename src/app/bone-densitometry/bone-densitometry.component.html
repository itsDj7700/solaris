                <p class="mb-4 jus">Bone densitometry, also known as Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA or DXA), is a medical imaging technique used to measure bone mineral density (BMD). This test is crucial for diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing an individual's risk of fractures.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 jus">Bone densitometry uses a small dose of ionizing radiation to produce images, typically of the lower spine and hips, to measure bone loss. It is a quick, non-invasive, and accurate method for evaluating bone health. Minimal preparation is required. Patients may be advised to avoid calcium supplements for 24 hours before the exam. Wear loose, comfortable clothing without metal zippers or buttons. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by weak and brittle bones. DEXA scans help in diagnosing this condition by measuring bone density and comparing it to standard values. By determining bone strength, DEXA scans can predict the likelihood of fractures, particularly in the hips and spine, which are common sites for osteoporotic fractures.Regular bone density tests can monitor the effectiveness of treatment for osteoporosis or other conditions that affect bone density. Helps in assessing bone loss due to other medical conditions or medications that affect bone health, such as rheumatoid arthritis or long-term steroid use.</p>
