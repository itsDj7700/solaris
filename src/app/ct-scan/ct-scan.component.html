                <p class="mb-4 jus">We are pioneers in the use of different CT procedures including dental CT. CT Scans of different parts of the body are obtained. Usually oral and injectable iodinated dyes have to be used.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 jus">A CT scan, or computed tomography scan, is a sophisticated imaging technique that uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body. It is an invaluable tool in medical diagnostics and treatment planning. A CT scanner consists of an X-ray source and multiple detectors that rotate around the patient. A computer processes these slices to create a detailed, three-dimensional image of the internal structures. CT scans are used to diagnose various conditions, including tumors, internal injuries, infections, and vascular diseases. They help plan and guide procedures like biopsies, surgeries, and radiation therapy. CT scans are used to monitor the progress of diseases and the effectiveness of treatments. Patients may need to avoid food and drink for several hours before the scan. A contrast dye might be used to enhance image clarity. The patient lies on a motorized table that moves through the CT scanner. The procedure is painless and typically takes a few minutes. There are usually no side effects, and patients can resume normal activities immediately.</p>
